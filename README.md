Note that the codebase is incomplete to make this page a true PWA. This demo page intends to only showcase how to fetch data from RESTApi endpoints using  [fetch api](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/03/introduction-to-fetch)  in Javascript.

Scotch.io has a very  [handy online guide](https://scotch.io/tutorials/the-ultimate-guide-to-progressive-web-applications)  so have a read and come back with a Pull Request and let's turn this Web App into a Progressive Web App!
